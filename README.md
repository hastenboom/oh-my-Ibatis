A fairly simple and messed simulation of mybatis. More bugs should be fixed and more refractories are required.

shortcoming:
1. The parameter binder is not extracted. And the order of argument list and placeholder list should be consistent;
2. The result binder is not extracted. The select result supports only for the single record, List<Object> should be supported in future;
3. Insert, update and delete are not supported yet;


Again, it's just for the learning purpose.
